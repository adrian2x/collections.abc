# ECMAScript 6 Collections Library

JavaScript has always lacked a strong, general purpose collections library, and altough many solutions have arised on the web, most of those are written in an old fashion pre-ES5 code style. **ESCollections** is inspired by Google's Closure library collections implementation, but rewritten in a modern, ES6-compliant style featuring great performance, flexibility and expressive apis.
